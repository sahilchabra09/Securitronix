![Securitronix Smart Door Lock](link-to-image.jpg)

**Project Description:**

Securitronix is a smart door lock conversion project that transforms your ordinary door lock into a high-tech, secure access control system. Developed during the Codewars hackathon, this project leverages the power of IoT and microcontrollers to enhance your door's security.

**Features:**

- **RFID Card Access:** Seamlessly access your door by presenting a valid RFID card.

- **PIN Entry:** Alternatively, you can enter a secure PIN code for access.

- **Security Measures:** If an unauthorized RFID card is used or the wrong PIN is entered, the system provides a non-lethal electric shock as an additional deterrent.

- **Raspberry Pi Pico W:** The core of the project is the Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller, providing a stable and efficient platform for this IoT solution.

- **Matrix Keypad:** A matrix keypad is integrated into the system, allowing for secure and convenient PIN entry.

- **RC522 RFID Card Reader Module:** The RC522 RFID card reader module is utilized for RFID card recognition, ensuring a reliable and user-friendly access system.

**Programming Language:**

The project is coded in MicroPython, which offers a user-friendly development environment and great compatibility with the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
